This is a Leonardo Da'Vinci Tribute Page

It shows a timeline with the main events in his life in the form of an unordered list

There is a figure with an img and its caption

Furthermore there is a section with a blockquote in between the figure and the list

And of course there is a title with a subtitle

This html elements had being positioned and style with CSS. They are resizeable for smaller screens.

This small proyect further increases my admiration of html and the structure and hierarchy of its elements. Once the elements are 
structured, I understood more about the positioning of them with css.

Also I know the importance of color in the design, so I used colors that make good contrast with each other while maintaining the pallete.

Finally there is a js file because I initially wanted to add the timeline's items with a script, but adding a strong element inside a dinamically created li element its quite struggling. Nevertheless in that js file you can see the commented script
