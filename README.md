# Web-Design-Short-Proyects
Some small web design proyects using CSS and HTML. Some exersices are from the ''Responsive Web Design Projects Certification' from Free Code Camp. 
Others its just me practicing with CSS. 

I had learned a lot about positioning using margins, paddings, width, height, floats, css flex and css grid. Also I learned about animations, color theory, box-shadows,
pseudo-classes. As well us types of position, measuring units and media queries.

With HTML I learned about the semantic meaning of the elements and their block or inline structure. That provides a solid skeleton for CSS to work with.

Furthermore styling my HTML with CSS allowed me to learn a lot about both languajes and create this proyects.

Now that I have experience with CSS and HTML I will add java script in future proyects. I learned JS and got 2 certifications, I will use it in my proyects to make them dynamic.

Finally I will learn REACT to solidigy my front-end capacities. 

I will also learn SQL to have some database knowledge.
