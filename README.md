# Web-Design-Tribute-Pages

In order to master HTML and CSS and move away from the basics I started doing several proyects. In this folder you can see two tribute pages.

The first one is from the ''Responsive Web Design Projects Certification' from Free Code Camp. 
The second one is a more complex one to further increase my knowledge.

Here I learned a lot about positioning using margins, paddings, width, height, floats, css flex and css grid. Also I learned about animations, color theory, box-shadows,
pseudo-classes. As well as types of position, measuring units and media queries to make responsive designs.

With HTML I learned about the semantic meaning of the elements and their block or inline structure. That provides a solid skeleton for CSS to work with.

Furthermore styling my HTML with CSS allowed me to learn a lot about both languajes and create this proyects.

Now that I have experience with CSS and HTML I will add java script in future proyects. I learned JS and got 2 certifications, I will use it in my proyects to make them dynamic.

Finally I will learn REACT to solidify my front-end capacities. 

I will also learn SQL to have some database knowledge.
