In this proyect I created a second tribute page, more advance than the first.

I keep learning about HTML elements, their semantic meaning and structures.

It has three sections: The first has a background image with elements over it (title, subtitle, media icons, blockquote).
                       Secondly there is an about section about the artist with a text and images.
                       Thirdly there is a discography section with 4 albums.
                       
I styled the HTML with CSS to make it attractive and simple. I learned knowledge about background-image positioning, image design, color theory, practical use of
the shadow-box property, pseudo-classes, css flex, text and typography edition, css variables and a better comprehension of CSS writing to make it easier to read.

Lastly I added media queries to make it responsive.

My following steps will be a survey form proyect, and later an e-commerce.
